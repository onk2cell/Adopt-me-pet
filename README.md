Pet Adoption React App
This project is a web application that allows users to search for pets available for adoption in their area. Users can browse pets by type, breed, and location, and they can see details about each pet, including photos, descriptions, and adoption fees.

The project is built using React, and it integrates with the Petfinder API to fetch data about adoptable pets. The application is responsive, so it works well on desktop and mobile devices.
